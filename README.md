## Introduction

This is a mod/plugin for the computer game Minecraft: Java Edition.\
With it installed, you can talk to a Minecraft world. You can send messages to it, and it will listen to you, and reply to you. You can command it, and it will oblige. You can choose any programming language you want to talk to it.

The only limit is your imagination.

### What can I do with it?

You can write programs that watch and manipulate the world of Minecraft.\
You can change any block in the world (if it exists, i.e. was generated) and its contents, same goes for the entities. You can manipulate the world's rules. You can listen to its events: you will know if a player is farming, or a lightning has spawned.

### How do I use it?

Your mod has to connect to a world of Minecraft. If you wish it to be a singleplayer world, install the mod onto your Minecraft game. Don't forget to choose a modloader (**Forge**/**Fabric**/**Neoforge**). After this, whichever world you join - it becomes programmable.
##### If you wish to control a multiplayer Minecraft server, I kindly ask you to read through [this tutorial](SERVER_README.md).

To write programs, you need to choose a programming language. This mod supports [**Python**](python), [**C++**](cpp), [**Java**](java), [**Lua**](lua), [**Node.js**](nodejs) (popular ones), [**C**](c), [**C#**](csharp), [**DyalogAPL**](dyalogapl), [**Elm**](elm), [**Elixir**](elixir), [**Go**](go), [**Haskell**](haskell), [**Kotlin**](kotlin), [**Ruby**](ruby) and [**VisualBasic**](visualbasic) (less popular ones). Now go, choose!

### What is this mod for?

When I was 12 years old, my mom bought me a book...
### No stories, please!
Okay. This mod's main principle is to be used for the educational purposes. Gaming is a fun way to teach something. This mod allows to interact with the Minecraft world through the power of programming. This project is designed with the expressed purpose of being an enjoyable and a learning experience simultaneously.

### This mod must have some sort of a community.

Right now it's the [GitHub Issue Page](https://github.com/vpgel/Minecraft-World-API/issues) of this project. Go ahead, open an issue called "No Discord server" xD
